# Hand_sign_detection
A deep learning project for detecting sign language , currently limited to three hand signs 


Our project is a step towards the ease of communication with people with hearing aid and speaking aid. A fully automated hand recognition system would help them to communicate with anyone and everyone irrespective of the fact that the other person knows hand sign language or not.
